### Introduction to typescript

TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript and a object oriented Programming Language which adds static typing means it adds syntax on top of Javascript


TypeScript uses 
-compile time type checking. 
(Which means it checks if the specified types match before running the code, not while running the code.)

* Lacking in javascript
-dynamically typed language
-hard to find bugs
-catch errors only in runtime


* Benefits in typescript 
-Supports older browser
-type safety
-increase your productivity
-Less Bugs and Less Testing

* Drawbacks of using Typescript
-type complexities
-limited library support
-over engineering
-migration challenges
